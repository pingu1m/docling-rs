In many parts of the world and in many industries, securing the data is required by law and subject to audits. Data security is no This chapter describes how you can secure and protect data in DB2 for i. The following topics

## 2 Row and Column Access Control Support in IBM DB2 for i

Because of the inherently secure nature of IBM i, many clients rely on the default system settings to protect their business data that is stored in DB2 for i. In most cases, this means no data protection because the default setting for the Create default public authority (QCRTAUT) system value is *CHANGE. Even more disturbing is that many IBM i clients remain in this state, despite the news headlines and the significant costs that are involved with databases being compromised. This default security configuration makes it quite challenging to implement basic security policies. A tighter implementation is required if you really want to protect one of your company's most valuable assets, which is the data. Traditionally, IBM i applications have employed menu-based security to counteract this default configuration that gives all users access to the data. The theory is that data is protected by the menu options controlling what database op erations that the user can perform. This approach is ineffective, even if the user profile is restricted from running interactive commands. The reason is that in today's connected world there are a multitude of interfaces into the system, from web browsers to PC clients, that bypass application menus. If there are no object-level controls, users of these newer interfaces have an open door to your data.

### 1.2 Current state of IBM i security

resource security. If implemented properly, resource security prevents data breaches from both internal and external intrusions. Resource security controls are closely tied to the part of the security policy that defines who should have access to what information resources. A hacker might be good enough to get through your company firewalls and sift his way through to your system, but if they do not have explicit access to your database, the hacker cannot compromise your information assets. With your eyes now open to the importance of securing information assets, the rest of this chapter reviews the methods that are available for securing database resources on IBM i.

security policy. Without a security policy, there is no definition of what are acceptable practices for using, accessing, and storing information by who, what, when, where, and how. A security policy should minimally address three things: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The monitoring and assessment of adherence to the security policy determines whether your security strategy is working. Often, IBM security consultants are asked to perform security assessments for companies without regard to the security policy. Although these assessments can be useful for observing how the system is defined and how data is being accessed, they cannot determine the level of security without a security policy. Without a security policy, it really is no t an assessment as much as it is a baseline for monitoring the changes in the security settings that are captured. A security policy is what defines whether the system and its settings are secure (or not). The second fundamental in securing data assets is the use of

Before reviewing database security techniques, there are two fundamental steps in securing information assets that must be described: First, and most important, is the definition of a company's

Some IBM i clients have tried augmenting the all-or-nothing object-level security with SQL application-based logic is easy to bypass with all of the different data access interfaces that Using SQL views to limit access to a subset of the data in a table also has its own set of challenges. First, there is the complexity of managing all of the SQL view objects that are used for securing data access. Second, scaling a view-based security solution can be difficult

Many businesses are trying to limit data access to a need-to-know basis. This security goal means that users should be given access only to the minimum set of data that is required to provides an all-or-nothing solution. For example, object-level controls allow a manager to access data about all employees. Most security policies limit a manager to accessing data

Separation of duties helps businesses comply with industry regulations or organizational requirements and simplifies the management of authorities. Separation of duties is commonly so that one user does not possess unlimited authority, such as with the *ALLOBJ authority.

To discover who has authorization to define and manage RCAC, you can use the query that is

Theresa. Before release IBM i 7.2, to grant privileges, Theresa had to have the same privileges Theresa was granting to others. Therefore, to grant *USE privileges to the PAYROLL table, Theresa had to have *OBJMGT and *USE authority (or a higher level of authority, such as *ALLOBJ). This requirement allowed Theresa to access the data in the PAYROLL table even though Theresa's job description was only to manage its security. table. QIBM_DB_SECADM function usage can be granted only by a user with *SECADM special authority and can be given to a user or a group. QIBM_DB_SECADM also is responsible for admi nistering RCAC, which restricts which rows a user is allowed to access in a table and whether a user is allowed to see information in certain columns of a table. A preferred practice is that the RCAC administrator has the QIBM_DB_SECADM function usage ID, but absolutely no other data privileges. The result is that the RCAC administrator can deploy and maintain the RCAC constructs, but cannot grant themselves unauthorized access to data itself. Table 2-2 shows a comparison of the different function usage IDs and *JOBCTL authority to the different CL commands and DB2 for i tools.

For example, assume that a business has assigned the duty to manage security on IBM i to In IBM i 7.2, the QIBM_DB_SECADM function usage grants authorities, revokes authorities, changes ownership, or changes the primary group without giving access to the object or, in the case of a database table, to the data that is in the table or allowing other operations on the
